# PatchApp
 Slow patcher, should get your files to where they need to be. Expect plenty of bugs and exceptions.
 
 The program can take up to 3 arguments. 
 
 1. mode - 1 or 2. 1 is to generate a patch, 2 is to apply patch to a file
 2. file1 - original file to patch
 3. file2 - modified file to generate patch from
 
 file2 is ingored when running in mode 2.
 
 Patch files of hugely different files will be massive, but should still work.
